## Overview

C++ is a powerful programming language widely used in competitive programming, algorithm design, and software development. This repository contains a set of C++ challenges designed to help you practice and improve your skills. The problems range in difficulty and cover various topics, allowing you to gradually build up your problem-solving abilities.

The goal is to understand how to approach problems, optimize solutions, and apply common algorithms and data structures.

### Key Concepts Covered:
- String manipulation
- Recursion and backtracking
- Dynamic programming
- Mathematical puzzles
- Data structures (arrays, linked lists, trees, etc.)

## Challenges

The repository contains multiple C++ challenges, each designed to practice different algorithmic techniques. Below is a general idea of the types of challenges you will find:

1. **String Manipulation**: Challenges that focus on reversing, checking palindromes, substring search, and other string-related problems.
   
2. **Recursion & Backtracking**: Problems that require recursive thinking and exploring all possible solutions, like solving puzzles or finding optimal paths.

3. **Dynamic Programming**: Problems that involve solving subproblems and storing intermediate results to avoid recomputations, such as knapsack problems, coin change problems, or longest common subsequences.

4. **Mathematical Puzzles**: Problems that require understanding of number theory, prime numbers, combinatorics, or other mathematical concepts.

5. **Data Structures**: Problems involving arrays, linked lists, trees, stacks, queues, heaps, and hashmaps.

## Usage

To work with any of the challenges, simply clone the repository and open the C++ files in your preferred editor or IDE.

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/C++-Challenges.git
   cd C++-Challenges
