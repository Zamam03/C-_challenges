## Overview

C++ is a powerful programming language widely used in competitive programming, algorithm design, and software development. This repository contains a set of C++ challenges designed to help you practice and improve your skills. The problems range in difficulty and cover various topics, allowing you to gradually build up your problem-solving abilities.

The goal is to understand how to approach problems, optimize solutions, and apply common algorithms and data structures.

### Key Concepts Covered:
- String manipulation
- Recursion and backtracking
- Dynamic programming
- Mathematical puzzles
- Data structures (arrays, linked lists, trees, etc.)

## Challenges

The repository contains multiple C++ challenges, each designed to practice different algorithmic techniques. Below is a general idea of the types of challenges you will find:

1. **String Manipulation**: Challenges that focus on reversing, checking palindromes, substring search, and other string-related problems.
   
2. **Recursion & Backtracking**: Problems that require recursive thinking and exploring all possible solutions, like solving puzzles or finding optimal paths.

3. **Dynamic Programming**: Problems that involve solving subproblems and storing intermediate results to avoid recomputations, such as knapsack problems, coin change problems, or longest common subsequences.

4. **Mathematical Puzzles**: Problems that require understanding of number theory, prime numbers, combinatorics, or other mathematical concepts.

5. **Data Structures**: Problems involving arrays, linked lists, trees, stacks, queues, heaps, and hashmaps.

Each challenge comes with an explanation of the problem, followed by the C++ solution and some examples.
Example

Hereâ€™s an example of how a typical challenge might be structured:
Challenge: Find the Largest Palindrome Substring

Problem Description: Given a string, find the longest palindrome substring in the string. A palindrome is a string that reads the same forward and backward.

Solution Code:

#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

string longestPalindrome(string s) {
    int n = s.length();
    if (n == 0) return "";

    int start = 0, maxLength = 1;

    for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
        for (int j = i; j < n; ++j) {
            int left = i, right = j;
            bool isPalindrome = true;

            // Check if substring is a palindrome
            while (left < right) {
                if (s[left] != s[right]) {
                    isPalindrome = false;
                    break;
                }
                left++;
                right--;
            }

            if (isPalindrome && (j - i + 1) > maxLength) {
                start = i;
                maxLength = j - i + 1;
            }
        }
    }

    return s.substr(start, maxLength);
}

int main() {
    string str = "babad";
    cout << "Longest Palindrome Substring: " << longestPalindrome(str) << endl;
    return 0;
}

Sample Input:

"babad"

Sample Output:

"bab"

Explanation: The longest palindrome substring in "babad" is "bab".
